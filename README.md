Hi Im Cristoval I'm a certified BI data analyst. I have spent the last 5 months working with data and discovering how to make data driven decisions. By making graphs and charts with the data it helped to make a visual that makes the data visually appealing. During the process of getting certified I had to mentally prepare myself for new things to learn that could be hard at first but convincing myself I could do it helped with getting me through the program. I would like to participate in outsourcing projects to sharpen my skills that I have learned from Triple Ten. The skills I learned are SQL, cleaning data and making reports based off of data made or cleaned and explaining the relevance of charts and how it helps to solve the problem. They also showed me how to make charts to help visualize my findings to give a clean picture of what the data is showing. They also taught me the different metrics that can be used to find information about profit, revenue, and retention rate of a business.
Fun facts about me:
Im self motivated
always eager to learn new skills/ sharpen my skills
used to working independently
enjoy working in groups
